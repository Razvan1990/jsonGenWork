	[description=Ana are mere;parameter_used=Param1;id_requirements=[Req1,Req2,Req3,Req4]]

-> a test must contain in this file the description, used parameters and requirements tested
-> they must be split using ;
-> do not use quotes nowhere
->the requirements, must be put in brackets, not matter if it is just one
2. After completing the json.template.txt correctly, save and go in Python
3. CLick the run button where you will be asked the model name, if MCDC is applicable and if there exists an argumentation file
4. Finally, the file will be generated in the the folder "generation" of the project.
